# Python-OOP

This is my personal repository which has a few python files taking the concept of Python OOP from creating basic classes to complex inheritance.
I made this repository public as a few of my friends wanted to these notes and I figured it would be easier to share these notes to the public so
that others may also benefit with the notes written in these files if they need to.

These notes are made based from Youtuber Clear Code's Python OOP video and would help those who don't want to spend 2 hours and want to learn quickly
or want to refresh their concepts. Keep in mind these notes were made in a way that accompanies watching the 2 hour tutorial, so I would recommend
watching the tutorial side by side
